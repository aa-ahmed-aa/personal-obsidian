## Want to do next (1 or 2 things)
- valid point but we are not doing it - try after work in `katana-insights` to add new db env in the database.json file and enter the pod and run `dp-migrate -e <new env>` and `db-migrate -e heroku` to see if you can migrate to two different db in the same time

- use docker image for timescale db on okteto
