LLM are large language model scoped to do some hard task

#### Chain 
is the LLM wrapped up in an object to work with it either invoke input or provide data to it

##### Retrieval (retriever)
is the Part to tell the LLM how your data to be retrieved for example you want to tell the LLM to 

#### Prompt
is the extended user input that will be sent to the ai model to even enhance the result or try to build the response around specific provided prompt
