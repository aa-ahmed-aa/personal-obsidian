The Kafka Connect JDBC Sink connector allows you to export data from Apache KafkaÂ® topics to any relational database with a JDBC driver. This connector can support a wide variety of databases. The connector polls data from Kafka to write to the database based on the topics subscription. It is possible to achieve idempotent writes with upserts. Auto-creation of tables and limited auto-evolution is also supported.
